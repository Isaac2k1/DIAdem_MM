tested the function from yesterday and found issues which are mentioned in the PROBLEMS section.


PROBLEMS:
with the if-statement which looks if the input is the new TNS_CAMPAIGN, you cannot display the channels for this shot.

You are not able to show the channels for your selected shot.--> only for the shots which have the new TNS_CAMPAIGN atteibute.
