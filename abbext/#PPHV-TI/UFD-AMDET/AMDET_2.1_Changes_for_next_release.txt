AMDET_2.1

The configuration variables from for the channel names typically has the channel name how it is stored in the lab.
Due to the time delay script of the laser measurement script, the measurement channels will be renamed.
Therefore the variables inside of the AMDET script are not right anymore and the script didnt work.

Channel conversion from waveform to numeric
Old system, data is stored with A_generated
new system is AB_generated

Only fixed for the new shots.
Need to be programmes more failsafe for both systems.

Scan function.
Depends on Channel, it can be both. A_generated or AB_generated.


Set Waveform X Name? That i can control the channel!

--> done


New measurement system, saves all data at the end with a 0.
Due to this, some details in the script doenst work.

1) delete the last points, if there are exact 0
2) set the points which are 0 to the value before
3) ignore the last points.

--> done



No info about that i changed the settings automatically
